      Open Source Systems features its own line of rackmount servers, desktops, and
      laptops and offers a wide array of services including open source enterprise
      migration, security, and network architecture services.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>eRacks
      Open Source Systems</b> strives to return the control of the IT department back
      to the business owner, by providing quality open source enterprise-level applications
      on easily-upgradable industry-standard hardware.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks believes
      businesses should not be required to rely on third-party closed-source software
      vendors.</p>\r\n<h5>\r\n\t&nbsp;It&#39;s all about independence.</h5>\r\n<div
      class=\"big\">\r\n\t<i>Being your own leader. Working toward your own goals.
      Enjoying freedom of access, ability to customize, while remaining independent
      of restrictions, licenses, and vendor lock-in. That&#39;s why eRacks believes
      the future lies in Open Source software. </i></div>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"\"

      itself in giving customers a wide choice of open source operating systems and
      software to be preconfigured on the systems they purchase.</p>\r\n<h5>\r\n\tHistory:</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks
      was founded by system architects and network design consultants who over the
      last twenty-five years have had first-hand experience setting up enterprise-level
      computing infrastructures. eRacks&#39; founders decided to leverage their expertise
      by designing ready-to-run systems, saving customers money, configuration time,
      and frustration.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe company was officially created at the end
      of 1999, and was then called <i>eRacks Appliances and Thin Systems</i>. The
      name was changed to <i>eRacks Open Source Rackmount Systems</i> in mid-2001
      and then shortened to <i>eRacks Open Source Systems</i> at the end of 2002.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe
      eRacks main facility was originally located in Laguna Beach, and moved to Orange,
      California in May 2006. eRacks also has offices in Silicon Valley, California.</p>\r\n<h5>\r\n\tNews:</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCompany

      screwing the front ears onto the shelf rail, with optional center/rear mounts
      providing additional support. Sliding railkits can be used to allow the system

      of your firewall simpler and easier. We don&#39;t enable FTP, Finger, or any

      remote management is accessed via SSH-port remapping. We include an open-source
      MS Windows SSH client with configuration instructions on how to access WebMin.
      This avoids opening up the firewall to additional ports such as WebMin&#39;s

      by 1.75 inches. The U refers to Unit or Rack Unit, and is sometimes abbreviated
      RU.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThere is a small amount of space allowed between
      systems when mounted on the rackshelf, so that the actual measured height of
      a rack unit is the number of Us minus 1/32 inch (= 0.031 inch) space between

      Hardware</h4>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tRackmount systems can be simply bolted to
      the rack-shelf at the front panel, or for heavier systems, rear/center brackets
      can add additional support.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tRackmount servers can also
      be attached to the rack shelf using sliding rails to allow the system to move
      similarly to a drawer. This is useful for repair/upgrade purposes, when the
      top of the chassis must be removed.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tNote the depth of
      the rack shelf unit as well as the rackmount system, when planning installation.
      Rack shelf depth is not standard, although depths of 39.4 inches (1,000 mm)
      is becoming more common in larger installations. At the widest shelf depth,
      some servers can be mounted both in the front and back.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tMost
      audio rack-shelves are shallower than general computer rack-shelves, and are
      in the range of 15 - 21 inch depth. It is sometimes possible to mount a system

      that some vendors purposely build non-standard rackmount servers, cabinets,
      mounting hardware and equipment, requiring the purchaser to buy the rack-shelf
      and/or mounting kits from same vendor. This is a vendor lock-in business strategy
      that eRacks has always strongly opposed.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\teRacks&#39;
      systems are all industry-standard, as well as the components within each system.
      No non-standard rack-mounting equipment is required.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf

      Delivery, and Payment Terms</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Payment Terms</b><br />\r\n\tFull
      payment may be rendered to eRacks by credit card, check in advance, wire transfer,
      cashier&#39;s check, or other negotiable methods, as determined by eRacks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf
      paid by credit card, charges for your order will appear on your credit card
      statement as a charge from eRacks Systems or one of its affiliates, such as
      Security Architects, Inc, or LZS Global Services, Inc, whom process and fulfill
      orders for eRacks. Depending on the shipping method chosen, direct shipping
      charges may appear on your credit card statement from DHL, UPS, or Federal Express,
      separately from your order charge.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition, credit review
      and approval by eRacks may result in Net 10 payment terms (Net 10 calendar days
      from date of invoice or shipment, whichever comes first), or COD / CIA company
      check. eRacks reserves sole discretion to place the customer on credit hold,
      in which event eRacks shall promptly notify the customer and may delay shipment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst
      orders from new customers may be subject to additional restrictions, such as
      no dropship (must ship to billing address), and cleared funds prior to order
      processing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInternational shipments and select domestic orders
      may be required to pay via wire transfer in advance, at eRacks&#39; sole discretion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOrders
      over $10,000 are subject to a 50% cleared-funds deposit prior to the build,
      at eRacks&#39; sole discretion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Delivery</b><br />\r\n\tAll
      products delivered pursuant to this agreement shall be shipped FOB origin to
      the customer ShipTo address set forth on the order form. Title of equipment
      passes to customer upon shipment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Time to ship</b><br />\r\n\tOur
      target time-to-ship for standard models is 5-10 business days, although special-order
      and backorder/allocation of components may cause time-to-ship to be up to 15
      business days. Custom-configured systems and systems requiring interoperability
      qualification or post-installation consulting may take longer to complete and
      test.&nbsp; Substitutions as required (see &quot;Products&quot; below) and email
      approvals from customers may lengthen order processing time. Time-to-ship is
      calculated from the date of receipt of cleared funds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Separate
      shipping ond other charges</b><br />\r\n\tOn select models (typically larger
      servers), shipping, packaging, pallet charges, freight, insurance, etc vary
      from order to order, and will typically be charged separately (usually by credit
      card) directly to the customer at the time of shipment.&nbsp; This typically
      saves the customer money by charging actual cost rather than a pre-set amount
      which would have to be high enough to cover worst-case scenarios.&nbsp; On request,
      eRacks can provide an estimate in advance and include it in your incvoice /
      payment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Invoice Date</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInvoice Date is
      defined as the date of the website purchase, or the date of the quote purchase
      / wire transfer / credit card charge, whichever comes first.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Cancellation
      and Restocking Fees</b><br />\r\n\tCanceled orders and orders returned within
      thirty days of invoice are subject to a 20% cancellation / restocking fee. The
      customer is responsible for return shipping charges, if any.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Products</b><br
      />\r\n\tDue to continuing technological advancements and fluctuations in supplier
      availability, eRacks reserves the right to alter product offerings at any time.
      eRacks shall put forth our best efforts in adhering to customer specifications,
      but conforming goods may be used to ensure quality and performance.&nbsp; Substitutions
      may be presented to customer for approval at eRacks&#39; discretion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Return
      Policy</b><br />\r\n\tThis policy applies to products shipped within the United
      States only. If not completely satisfied with eRacks products, customer may
      return them to eRacks within 30 days of invoice for a refund of the purchase
      price, less shipping and handling costs and a 20% restocking fee. Customer must
      ship products back to eRacks in original packaging and condition, and prepay
      shipping charges. Customer assumes the risk for loss or damage during shipment.
      Customer is advised to insure the return shipment with the carrier. &nbsp;All
      returns require an eRacks-issued RMA number and approval prior to being received
      at eRacks. The approved RMA number must be prominently visible on the outside
      of the packaging.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>RMA and Hardware Support Policy</b>:<br
      />\r\n\tOur support technicians will help you evaluate your problem and issue
      RMA numbers for any returns. Email <a href=\"mailto:support@eracks.com\">support@eracks.com</a>
      with any system problems. Any component or system returned to eRacks must have
      a valid RMA number noted on the outside of the package, or the package will
      be returned.<br />\r\n\t1. Drive failures: The customer may choose to remove
      the drive from the system and return it to eRacks, or for more expedience, directly
      to the manufacturer. eRacks will cross-ship components, only with a credit card
      guarantee. Customer is repsponsible for shipping charges.<br />\r\n\t2. CPU
      or CPU Cooler failure: eRacks should replace these components in-house. Obtain
      an RMA number and return the unit.<br />\r\n\t3. Operating System install/re-install:
      eRacks will install, configure and test your system with your choice of operating
      system. eRacks&#39; warranty is only valid with your original configuration.
      Any configuration issues, hardware incompatibilities, or other issues as the
      result of the customer&#39;s installation, re-installation, or re-building of
      an operating system are not covered by the warranty. Machines ordered with no
      operating system specified will be tested with a generic Linux install and any
      issues arising as a result of the customer&#39;s operating system installation
      are the customer&#39;s responsibility.<br />\r\n\t4. Any other problems: The
      customer shall obtain a valid RMA number and return the entire system to eRacks
      for repair, with the RMA number clearly indicated on the outside of the box.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks
      may, at its sole discretion, identify products that are not returnable.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Service
      and Support</b><br />\r\n\teRacks is committed to providing the highest quality
      customer and technical support. Standard technical support is available for
      one (1) year from the invoice date. The number of technical support incidents
      with the standard support package is limited to five (5) for each system purchased.
      eRacks supports the configuration of the system as purchased. Support may not
      include re-installation of the operating system or the installation and configuration
      of hardware not purchased from eRacks. eRacks does not offer support for dual
      boot systems or for the integration of our servers with other systems. eRacks
      has no obligation to provide service or support until it has received payment
      in full for the product for which the support is requested.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Environmental
      considerations</b><br />\r\n\tEvery effort is made to ensure your system functions
      flawlessly under normal operating conditions. Abnormal or nonstandard operating
      conditions, such as high-temperature or high-humidity environments, operating
      in the sun, radiant or contact heat from other nearby objects, or excessively
      high CPU utilization under constant conditions, may occasionally cause heat
      or stress-related issues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a class=\"c4\" name=\"warranty\">eRacks

      be provided.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tExtended warranties area available at an additional
      cost:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>2. Extended 2yr full / 3yr Limited Warranty</b><br
      />\r\n\tThe Extended Warranty covers two years of full parts and labor, and
      up to 3 years of warranty of individual components, as included by the component&#39;s

      eRacks Open Source Systems announces a new custom line of pre-configured desktop
      computers, rackmount servers, and NAS Network Attached Storage servers available
      through Amazon.</i><br />\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAugust 27, 2012- Orange, CA - <a href=\"http://www.prlog.org/11960162-eracks-launches-amazon-storefront-featuring-custom-line-of-computers-and-servers.html\">PRLog</a>
      -</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\teRacks Open Source Systems announces a new custom line
      of pre-configured desktop computers, rackmount servers, and NAS Network Attached
      Storage servers available through Amazon. The new line was designed and assembled
      by eRacks expert team of computer engineers in their Southern California facility.
      Consumers will now have access to the same custom built enterprise-level computer
      systems used by NASA, ILM (Industrial Light &amp; Magic), Motorola, Sony, Google,
      and others. These systems were previously unavailable to the general public.
      The entire line of systems is also fully upgradeable. The ability to upgrade
      will typically extend the life of most systems by several years, saving consumers
      substantial time and money.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tOne of the highlights of the
      new Amazon storefront is the AresPro Dual Xeon Sixteen Core desktop workstation.
      The AresPro line is the perfect solution for engineers, video editors, high-end
      gamers, and graphic designers seeking an affordable and entirely upgradeable
      system. The eRacks AresPro line delivers more power, better graphics performance
      and more storage options than anything else on the market. The sixteen core
      AresPro features a 1000watt PSU, SuperMicro X9DAI-0 Motherboard, dual Intel
      Xeon E5-2650 2.0GHz eight-core processor,32GB 1600MHz DDR3 Memory ,2 x 2TB SATA3
      7200rpm hard drives, RAID 1, Nvidia 560TI Graphics, Asus Xonar DG 5.1 Sound
      Card, Blueray Burner, and Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit OS. All eRacks systems come
      with a Standard 1yr full / 3yr Limited Warranty, which includes one full one
      year parts and labor, and up to 3 years of individual components&#39; warranties
      as included by the manufacturer.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAs always, the entire line
      of eRacks systems is available online through eRacks website. Most of eRacks
      clients prefer customized hardware and software configurations, and some even
      opt to have eRacks configure a set of systems, staging it in-house before delivery.
      For more information visit the eRacks website: http://www.eracks.com or call

      TheVARGuy.com<br />\r\n\t\tDate: May 21, 2012</a></p>\r\n\t<div class=\"c7\">\r\n\t\t<img
      alt=\"\" src=\"/images/press/eracks_web_logopng.png\" /></div>\r\n\tGamers are
      not exactly the first group that comes to mind when one thinks of Linux users.
      Yet <a href=\"http://eracks.com\">eRacks</a>, a PC vendor specialized in open
      source systems, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/eracks-announces-arespro-line-high-performance-desktop-computers-070754619.html\">recently
      launched</a> a new line of high end desktops, called AresPro, aimed at gamers
      and other customers with specific needs for powerful computers. Here&#39;s the
      scoop, and its meaning for the open source channel.\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAdmittedly,
      gamers are not the only group to whom eRacks &mdash; which The VAR Guy himself
      <a href=\"http://www.thevarguy.com/the-open-source-50/up-and-comers/\">has identified</a>
      as a top up and coming open source company &mdash; hopes to cater with its new
      systems. According to its press release, it has engineers, graphic designers
      and video editors in mind as well. And the systems can be purchased with either
      Microsoft Windows or a variety of open source operating systems (or both, in
      a dual boot setup) preinstalled, meaning that many of the gamers who purchase
      these PCs may simply be traditional Windows users.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tBut it&#39;s
      notable nonetheless that an OEM specialized in hardware designed for open source
      platforms has turned its attention to the gaming crowd. Maybe eRacks has noticed
      that an increasing number of Linux games run quite well using the <a href=\"http://www.winehq.org/\">Wine</a>
      emulator, which makes Linux a more viable platform for gamers. (Sidenote: technically
      &quot;<a href=\"http://wiki.winehq.org/Debunking_Wine_Myths\">Wine is not an
      emulator</a>,&quot; but it&#39;s close enough.) Meanwhile other first rate games
      with native Linux support, like <a href=\"http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/\">0
      A.D.</a>, are <a href=\"http://www.thevarguy.com/2011/12/28/open-source-game-0-a-d-again-seeking-cash-for-programmers/\">in
      development</a> and may well mean that Windows will cease to be the near exclusive
      domain of the gaming crowd that it has traditionally been.</p>\r\n\t<p class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tAresPro
      Features</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIn any case, whether their chief concern is gaming,
      engineering, design or something else, Linux users searching for high end PCs
      stand to be well pleased by eRacks&rsquo;s new offering. The AresPro machines
      boast 16 core CPUs and up to 768 gigabytes of memory (which, I&#39;ll add, is
      a mind-boggling figure &mdash; back when I built my first PC in 2001, I thought
      I was a huge deal rocking half a gigabyte of RAM), along with the high end video
      cards, SSD storage, liquid cooling and other fancy features that one expects
      on PCs of that caliber.</p>\r\n\t<div class=\"c9\">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://eracks.com/products/Desktops/config?sku=ARESPRO\"><img
      alt=\"\" src=\"/images/press/arespro_136x300.jpeg\" /></a><br />\r\n\t\tAresPro
      PC</div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\teRacks promises that the machines will support Windows
      7, as well as a range of popular Linux distributions and some of the BSDs. A
      company representative with whom I spoke, however, reported that most AresPro
      orders so far have been for Windows, a trend that the company anticipates to
      continue. But he added that &ldquo;our sales team will definitely offer dual
      boot options to anyone who wants it at no extra charge.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\t<p class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tHigh
      End PCs and Open Source</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIt shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone,
      of course, if most of the AresPro machines end up running only Windows. But
      the simple fact that eRacks is offering state of the art PCs to the open source
      crowd is notable, since typically the only high performance machines available
      with Linux or one of the BSDs preloaded are intended to be used as servers,
      not desktops. A few other OEMs, like <a href=\"http://zareason.com/shop/home.php\">ZaReason</a>
      and <a href=\"http://www.system76.com/\">System76</a>, offer high-spec&#39;d
      desktop machines with Linux preinstalled, but the selection nonetheless remains
      limited.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe AresPro announcement is thus good news for
      those open source users who want high end PCs without paying the Windows tax.
      It&#39;s also a plus for the open source channel as a whole, which needs all
      the love from hardware vendors that it can get.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n", created: ! '2012-05-21

      alt=\"\" src=\"/images/press/glasses.jpeg\" /></div>\r\n\tWhen The VAR Guy launched
      his website in January 2008, our resident blogger kept a super close eye on
      open source channel partner programs. At one point, The VAR Guy published the
      &lt; href=&quot;http://www.thevarguy.com/the-open-source-50/&quot;&gt;Open Source
      50 &mdash; tracking how the top open source companies were working with VARs
      and IT service providers. So whatever happened to each of the 50 companies in
      that annual list? Some are dead, some are thriving, and many have repositioned
      for cloud computing, Big Data and other buzz words. Here&rsquo;s a belated update
      from The VAR Guy in alphabetical order&hellip;\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t1. Acquia: The
      Drupal specialist still has a partner program for service providers, and Drupal&rsquo;s
      popularity as a content management platform has grown extensively.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t2.
      Actuate: Still focused on the Eclipse BIRT (Business Intelligence and Reporting
      Tools) open source project.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t3. Alfresco Software Inc.: Still
      promoting itself as the leading open source alternative to enterprise content
      management. Now managing more than 6.6 million users and 3.3 billion documents
      worldwide.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t4. Astaro Corp.: Once positioned as an a unified
      threat management (UTM) system that leveraged open source. Now owned by Sophos,
      the endpoint security and anti-virus company.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t5. Canonical:
      The Ubuntu promoter has pushed beyond desktop Linux to promote server and cloud
      options for channel partners and customers. Still a well-known name, but the
      rise of tablets and smartphones running Apple iOS and Google Android seems to
      have stolen some of Ubuntu&rsquo;s spotlight. Memo to Director of Communications
      Gerry Carr: Let&rsquo;s catch up.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t6. ClearCenter: Still
      positioning itself as a provider of an open software platform for running Server,
      Network, &amp; Gateway services. Recently announced a relationship with Zarafa,
      the open source email system. It has been awhile since The VAR Guy spoke with
      ClearCenter CEO Michael Proper. How&rsquo;s life, Michael?</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t7.
      Cleversafe: The storage company, launched in 2004, had a strong open source
      market presence but appeared to change directions around September 2010, when
      open source related forums were removed from its website. These days, Cleversafe
      describes itself as a company that solves big data storage problems, with no
      mention of open source.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t8. Compiere Inc.: Consona acquired
      Compiere, an open source ERP specialist, in 2010. The old Compiere website is
      still online, but channel partners would be wise to visit the Consona&rsquo;s
      Compiere landing page.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t9. Continuent Inc.: Still focused
      on database replication technology, particularly for Oracle and MySQL environments
      &mdash; plus a channel partner program for VARs.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t10. Digium
      Inc.: Promoter of Asterisk, the open source IP PBX. Most recently launched its
      own line of IP phones, giving channel partners end-to-end unified communications
      solutions for customers. But The VAR Guy wonders: Will Digium ever launch its
      own Asterisk offering in the cloud? Hmmm&hellip;</p>\r\n\t<p class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tTired
      Yet? Read On for 11 to 20</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t11. DotNetNuke Corp.: Promoter
      of a web content management platform for Microsoft .NET environments. Find partner
      program information here.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t12. eBox Technologies: The company
      changed its name to Zentyal in August 2010. Zentyal continues to promote a Linux
      small business server.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t13. EnterpriseDB: Still positioning
      itself as a PostgreSQL open source alternative to Oracle databases. The company
      has a growing list of SaaS and cloud channel partners.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t14.
      <b>eRacks Open Source Systems</b>: Apparently humming along, providing open
      source rackmount servers and desktop computers.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t15. Eucalyptus
      Systems: The open source cloud company in April 2012 raised $30 million in new
      funding, but competition from OpenStack and perhaps Citrix CloudStack seems
      to be intensifying.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t16. Fluendo SA: Still focused on multi-media
      solutions for open source. Recently joined the Linux Foundation.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t17.
      GroundWork Open Source (GWOS): Now known more simply as GroundWork Inc., still
      focused on IT monitoring solutions but various partner program efforts (including
      an MSP push) never quite went mainstream. Some partners are still listed here.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t18.
      Ingres Corp.: The open source database provider repositioned as Actian Corp.
      in September 2011 to focus on a cloud development platform for consumer style
      apps. The rebranding came about three months after Ingres (er, Actian) had changed
      CEOs.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t19. Intalio Inc.: Still focused on private cloud computing
      but the company&rsquo;s news page hasn&rsquo;t been updated since July 2011.
      Hmmm&hellip;</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t20. IPBrick International: Still focused on
      unified communications, VoIP with a touch of Linux mixed in.</p>\r\n\t<p class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tYou
      Can&#39;t Quit Reading Now: 21 to 30</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t21. Jaspersoft Corp.:
      Still focused on the business intelligence software market, with growing initiatives
      around cloud computing, big data, and mobile deployments.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t22.
      JumpBox Inc.: Continues to offer &ldquo;hassle free&rdquo; open source server
      software. But there are few, if any, signs of a partner program.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t23.
      Kaltura Inc.: Still promoting an open source video platform.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t24.
      KnowledgeTree Inc.: Back in 2007, KnowledgeTree positioned itself as the world&rsquo;s
      leading open source document management system. Today, KnowledgeTree calls itself
      the online document management solution provider.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t25. Likewise
      Software: Focused on identity management, security and storage, Likewise originally
      built software that let Linux, Unix and Mac systems authenticate to Microsoft
      Active Directory. EMC acquired Likewise in March 2012.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t26.
      Magnolia International: Continues to position itself as an open web content
      management system.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t27. Mandriva SA: Crashed and burned but
      hoping for a comeback.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t28. Mindtouch: Social help company
      repositioned from open source to SaaS in 2010.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t29. MuleSoft:
      Positioned itself as &ldquo;the leading provider of open source infrastructure
      and integration software&rdquo; in 2007. Today, MuleSoft prefers to say it &ldquo;provides
      the most widely used integration platform for connecting SaaS and enterprise
      applications in the cloud and on-premise.&rdquo; Still running a partner program.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t30.
      MySQL: The open source database is now owned by Oracle, and positioned as an
      alternative to Microsoft SQL Server.</p>\r\n\t<p class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tMore Than
      Half-Way Done: 31 to 40</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t31. Novell: Sold to Attachmate in
      2011, and the SUSE Linux business is now more of a freestanding business under
      Attachmate&rsquo;s ownership, free of Novell&rsquo;s shadow.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t32.
      Nuxeo: Still positioning itself as an open source enterprise content management
      system. Double revenues in 2011, and Nuxeo announced 12 new SI partners and
      9 new technology partners.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t33. Open-Xchange: The company
      continues to promote open source email to hosting providers and SaaS specialists.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t34.
      Openbravo: Still focused on open source ERP, revenues grew 143 percent in 2011.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t35.
      Opengear: Still providing advanced console server and enterprise grade remote
      management solutions.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t36. Pentaho: Pushing its open source
      experience to promote big data analytics.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t37. Red Hat Inc.:
      The biggest ongoing winner on our list, Red Hat has pushed beyond Linux to promote
      JBoss middleware, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, Red Hat Storage and a range
      of cloud-oriented solutions. Oh, and Red Hat became the world&rsquo;s first
      $1 billion open source company a few months ago.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t38. rSmart:
      Promoter of open source management software for colleges. Things have been a
      little quiet in 2012. The VAR Guy needs a closer look.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t39.
      SpringSource: Now a division of VMware, and positioned as a cloud application
      platform.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t40. StarPound Technologies Inc.: Positioned as
      an open source unified communications company in 2008. Now positioned as a cloud-based
      call center. But is StarPound still active? Hmmm&hellip; (Side note: Winner
      for most creative company name on this list, combining the Star button and the
      Pound button from the phone to create &ldquo;StarPound.&rdquo;)</p>\r\n\t<p
      class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tFinish Line Ahead: 41 to 50</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t41. SugarCRM
      Inc.: Still in growth mode, and still working closely with channel partners.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t42.
      Talend Inc.: Still positioned as the open source integration company. Making
      noise in the Big Data market.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t43. Untangle: The open source
      security company has repositioned a bit, pushing beyond software to introduce
      firewall appliances in 2012.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t44. Vyatta Inc.: Positioned
      itself in 2007 as an open networking company that focused on an open source
      network operating system and routing system to compete against Cisco. Now the
      company barely mentions open source, positioning itself instead as &ldquo;the
      leader in software-based networking for virtual and cloud environments.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t45.
      Xandros Corp.: The Linux specialist apparently imploded around 2010.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t46.
      xTuple: Continues to position itself as commercial open source company focused
      on business applications across sales, accounting and operations. Sort of ERP
      in the open source market. Company was very quiet in 2011, but starting to make
      some news again in 2012.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t47. Zarafa: Still positioned as
      open source email platform. Partnered with ClearCenter (#6, above) in March
      2012.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t48. Zenoss Inc.: Promotes IT operations management
      software for physical and virtual environments. The company barely mentions
      open source in its news releases these days, saying instead that it offers unified
      IT operations software for physical, virtual, and cloud-based IT infrastructure.
      The company continues to grow rapidly, generating 196 percent new sales growth
      in Q4 2011.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t49. Zimbra: Now owned by VMware, and still positioned
      as an open source email alternative to Microsoft Exchange. But have things been
      a little quiet with Zimbra lately? Hmmm&hellip; There was that Zimbra win with
      EarthLink.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t50. Zmanda Inc.: Still positioned as an open
      source-based provider of enterprise backup and disaster recovery. Most recently,
      Zmanda integrated its storage software with Google Cloud Storage.</p>\r\n\t<p
      class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tKeeping Score</p>\r\n\t<p class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tWow, that&#39;s
      quite a lengthy list. The final scorecard:</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tRoughly six of
      the 50 open source companies have been acquired since around 2008.<br />\r\n\t\tRoughly
      eight of the 50 open source companies now downplay open source in their news
      announcements.<br />\r\n\t\tAt least two of the companies have changed their
      names.<br />\r\n\t\tAt least two of the companies have either closed or are
      on life support.<br />\r\n\t\tJust about all of the companies listed now promote
      terms like cloud computing, cloud services and Big Data management.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThat&#39;s

      custom NAS50 network attached file server from eRacks Open Source Systems is
      at the forefront of network server design utilizing the new 4TB hard drives
      from Western Digital, making petabyte-scale data storage within two rack cabinets
      a reality.\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/4/prweb9434605.htm\">PRWeb</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tOrange,
      CA, April 25, 2012 -- eRacks Open Source Systems has integrated the latest 4TB
      Western Digital drives into their NAS50 network attached storage file server.
      Users can now store up to 1.6 petabytes in a customized two rack system. The
      NAS50 will enable users to consolidate vast amounts of data, improve network
      reliability, save office space, reduce energy consumption and strengthen network
      security. The recent Mac Flashback virus has proved that any system is vulnerable
      to attack. The NAS50 is also fully customizable online with the full range of
      the latest network security features. Business and home users craving larger
      capacities for storage can also create customized hardware configurations online.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tMax
      Haskvitz, general manager of eRacks says, &quot;We&#39;re especially excited
      to offer our customers the upgraded NAS50. The ability to house 200TB in a single
      unit is extremely efficient for data warehouses and other storage-needy applications.&quot;
      The NAS50 is already being used by NASA and several major national networks
      and engineers for data retention, cloud storage, storing uncompressed media
      files, and creating multiple backups.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tIn addition
      to 200TB of storage, the eRacks/NAS50 holds a maximum of two eight-core Intel
      Xeon or four AMD Opteron CPUs for a total of 16 Intel cores or 64 AMD cores.
      Memory can be upgraded up to 768GB DDR3 and multiple RAID arrays can be configured.
      eRacks also offers 4GbE and 10GbE network interfaces for the eRacks/NAS50 server.
      An external SAS option enables multiple NAS50 servers or other NAS units together
      for peta-scale storage.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tMost of eRacks clients prefer
      customized hardware and software configurations, and some even opt to have eRacks

      CA, April 09, 2012 -- eRacks Open Source Systems introduces a new high performance,
      energy efficient line of rackmount severs. The new Eseries line is a perfect
      upgrade for companies who are looking for ways of reducing their electricity
      bills and minimizing environmental impact by cutting back on energy consumption
      and e-waste. eRacks owner and founder Joseph Wolff says, &quot;Our new Eseries
      line truly breaks through previous price/performance barriers, gives our customers
      the highest processing power available, and raises the bar for unprecedented
      server operating efficiency and &#39;Green&#39; energy-efficient features.&quot;</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tThe
      new Intel powered servers by eRacks are a perfect upgrade for businesses of
      every size. eRacks is offering 3 new fully customizable servers powered by the
      new Intel Xeon E5-2600 series. With a base price of only $1495, the SANDYTOWER
      is an industry leader in value and performance. The SANDYTOWER includes the
      blazing fast Xeon E5-2600 series by Intel and is expandable up to 128 GB RAM.
      Businesses will easily be able to upgrade their servers as they grow. The ability
      to upgrade and expand their servers, rather than just replacing them, will help
      businesses cut down on environmentally harmful e-waste.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tFor
      larger businesses, or those who simply demand more storage space and computing
      power, eRacks is offering the ENTERPRISE and ESERVE models. Both models will
      feature hot-swap drive technology, enabling real time upgrades without disrupting
      or shutting down the network. The ESERVE is a virtual powerhouse which boasts
      a Xeon 2600 series processor, X79 based motherboard, expandable memory up to
      512 GB, Dual Layer DVDRW and will support up to 8 hot-swap SAS/SATA drives.

      eRacks Open Source Systems announces expansion of its rackmount server lineup
      with customized blade server models. Several configurations are available including
      a twin blade system capable of 20 nodes per 7U of rackmount height.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks
      announces a new category of blade server configurations in its rackmount server
      lineup. Blade server technology is an efficient way to scale server capacity
      while limiting space and power needs.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tBlades are primarily
      suitable for high density server farms, where efficiency and cost-to-operate
      are significant. Each of eRacks blade servers has its own memory, CPUs, GPUs,
      hard drives, and network connections, and can be hot-swapped. Several blade
      servers reside together in one enclosure which provides the power and cooling
      for the set. An eRacks fully-populated blade enclosure can house between 10
      and 14 blades, including twin-node blades. Populated with the eRacks/TBLADE
      twin-node blade server, a density of 20 dual-processor nodes in a 7U rackmount
      height is reached.</p>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\tAdvantages of blade rackmounts
      over standard rackmount servers:\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t1 - Reliability - Redundant
      servers, power supplies, and RAID drives, are all designed with hotswap capability.
      One server or drive or power supply can be removed without bringing down the
      others.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t2 - Space efficiency - Server density can
      more than twice that of traditional 1U rackmount servers.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t3
      - Cable reduction - The BLADE10 and BLADE14 enclosures provide network, power,
      and KVM cabling reduction. Keeping cabling simpler reduces management time and
      errors.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t4 - Lower power consumption and operating
      costs - By eliminating the overhead of discrete 1U servers, power consumption
      and electricity costs are significantly decreased.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t5
      - Faster troubleshooting, without downtime - Power supplies, drives, blades,
      all can be hot-swapped.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t6 - Disaster management
      - Redundant power modules in each enclosure are designed to provide a failover,
      maintaining uptime.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t7 - Remote management - eRacks
      blades servers have integrated IPMI2.0 (Intelligent Platform Management Interface)
      and KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine).</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t8 - Scalability
      - Once a blade server chassis has been installed, additional servers can be
      added by simply sliding them into the bays while the system is running.</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tCombining
      blade technology with software virtualization allows incredible advantages in
      modularization, which in turn, can make it simpler to scale. Virtualization
      allows each application to reside in its own environment, including the operating
      system and software best suited to its tasks. eRacks experts can also configure
      servers with the customer&#39;s choice of virtualization software or other software
      especially designed to scale, such as Apache Hadoop.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tAn
      optimal infrastructure that maximizes density, plus has ability to scale, will
      also provide a smaller footprint resulting in environmental benefits and cost
      savings. eRacks Blade Enclosures&#39; power supplies have 94% power efficiency
      with a highly effective cooling subsystem design. Each blade also has integrated
      IPMI2.0 with remote KVM, capable of full remote management, for peace of mind.
      Network options include Infiniband DDR/QDR and 10G Ethernet, which are available
      on every blade model. While most resellers offer only a general blade model,
      eRacks offers a variety of configurations for differing applications.</p>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\teRacks
      Blade models include:\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t- eRacks/XBLADE, an Intel Xeon-based,
      Quad-core / Six-core, Single / Dual CPU server supporting up to six drives.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t-
      eRacks/ABLADE, an AMD Opteron-based Single, Dual, or Quad-CPU blade server.
      Density can be up to 640 cores per 7U.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t- eRacks/YBLADE,
      a Xeon blade for more processor-intensive applications that can scale to a density
      of 14 servers per 7U.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t- eRacks/RENDERBLADE, which
      holds two graphic cards per blade.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t- eRacks/TBLADE,
      a twin-node blade server capable of a 20-node, 2.56TB memory per 7U.</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tMax
      Haskvitz, eRacks Operations Manager says, &quot;eRacks prides itself on offering
      standard blade servers that are interoperable, rather than resorting to the
      proprietary lock-in practices of other blade vendors such as HP and Dell. We
      also strive to demystify blade technology, and assist our customers in planning
      their infrastructure.&quot;</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tMost of eRacks clients prefer
      customized hardware and software configurations, and some even opt to have eRacks
      configure a set of systems, staging it in-house before delivery. For more information

      eRacks releases upgraded configurations of rackmount server models, available
      online.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks Open Source Systems has revamped and
      upgraded the configurations of their General Purpose category rackmount servers.
      In spite of component shortages and rising prices due to the flooding of hard
      drive factories in Thailand, eRacks has increased the capacities of components
      in their online computer server models, while keeping prices level.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks
      Open Source Systems, based in Orange, California, offers rackmount servers and
      computers, and has an increasingly large following among Linux users and other
      Open Source advocates. Customized rackmount servers are eRacks&#39; main products,
      but selections of Linux desktops and laptops are also available online. eRacks&#39;
      latest refresh includes AMD&#39;s Bulldozer Interlagos processors, and Intel&#39;s
      Sandy Bridge, and Ivy Bridge series in the General Purpose line-up. Desktop
      and Quiet System users can also benefit from the new socket 2011 and FM1 systems
      featuring the FX line from AMD and the Sandy Bridge E for Intel. Also the cards
      from LSI, Fusion IO, 3ware, and Intel allow many storage and communication options.
      Combining all that together with the ability of GbE to 4, 20,40 and 100GbE connectivity,
      as well as all forms of wireless, really allow this line-up to sparkle.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe
      entry-level eRacks/VALUE rackmount server starts at $595, and features a choice
      of Intel Celeron or i3 CPU. All General Purpose models are configured with SATA3
      hard drives as the default, with SSD included in the options. The eRacks/SERVE

      style=\"float: right;\" /></a><br />\r\n\t\tNovember 21, 2011 Orange, CA\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tSummary:
      eRacks, a provider of configured open source rackmount servers, announces three
      levels of redundant firewall systems, called the TWINGUARD series. Each system
      contains two complete servers, automatically providing a failover should one
      server go down.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks announces its latest line of
      fully-redundant dual firewalls, the TWINGUARD, TWINGUARD.PRO and TWINGUARD.ENTERPRISE
      rackmount servers. The Twinguard series minimizes risk in mission critical networks
      where failure is never an option. When one firewall fails, the other kicks in
      immediately, meaning no lost connectivity.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tWhen a network
      must be online and maintained 24 hours a day, it&#39;s crucial to ensure that
      there are no single points of failure. Redundancy is vital for a firewall, one
      of the most important components in most networks. A failure in a firewall can
      spell sudden disaster, interrupting access to an entire network.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tTwinguard
      series systems come in three flavors. TWINGUARD, the most basic option, utilizes
      three gigabit ethernet ports per node and dual core Intel Atom processors, providing
      maximum value for smaller networks. Next is the TWINGUARD.PRO, which also sports
      three gigabit NICs as well as Intel Core 2 Duo processors for more moderately-sized
      networks requiring moderate computational power. Finally, the TWINGUARD.ENTERPRISE
      provides three 10GbE ports and Intel Xeon processors, providing blazing fast
      network connections and speedy CPUs, appropriate for large enterprise-scale
      networks where high bandwidth and computational power are a must.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe
      eRacks/TWINGUARD runs the user&#39;s choice of OpenBSD or FreeBSD and utilizes
      CARP and PFSync software for full redundancy. Since OpenBSD and FreeBSD are

      announces a new rackmount server model, the eRacks/SANDYCORE, available now.
      It utilizes the Sandy Bridge CPU, Intel&#39;s second generation of 32nm Core
      processors, offering performance boosts for graphics and computational intensive
      applications.\r\n\t\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOrange, CA (PRWEB)
      February 28, 2011 -- eRacks Open Source Systems unveils the eRacks/SANDYCORE,
      a new rackmount server model based on Intel&#39;s newest Sandy Bridge CPU architecture.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSandy
      Bridge CPUs are currently available in either dual-core or quad-core flavors,
      with 6-core and 8-core models coming later in the year. Base models sport clock
      speeds as high as 3.4GHz and can be overclocked to 3.8GHz using Intel&#39;s
      Turbo Boost Technology. Enthusiasts who want to push their CPUs further can
      opt for the K series, which features an unlocked multiplier, allowing the clock
      to be driven as fast as 5.7GHz. In addition to fast clock speeds, Intel&#39;s
      latest line executes instructions roughly twice as fast as previous models.
      All Sandy Bridge CPUs introduce a new set of instructions, dubbed AVX (Advanced
      Vector Extensions), for floating point intensive calculations, which will significantly
      improve the performance of applications designed to take advantage of it. All
      Sandy Bridge processors come with a whopping 8MB of L3 cache, and future processors
      to be released in the fourth quarter of 2011 will possess as much as 20MB.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAll
      of these exciting improvements by no means come at the cost of increased power
      consumption. In fact, Sandy Bridge is more efficient in its use of energy than
      its predecessors, which is great news for laptop owners who care about conserving
      battery life as well as for the environmentally conscious.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWith
      so many cores, and with improved support for floating point operations, the
      Sandy Bridge processor makes an ideal choice for individuals interesting in
      editing video, rendering 3D graphics and even playing games.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEarlier
      in the year, concerns arose regarding a design flaw that effected the SATA2
      ports on Sandy Bridge motherboards. All affected models were recalled and have
      since been replaced by boards that do not suffer from this problem. Thus, eRacks
      customers can rest assured that they will be provided with reliable hardware.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe
      eRacks/SANDYCORE features open source software *by default*, liberating the
      user from cumbersome and costly software licenses. Operating system choices
      include all flavors of Linux and *BSD.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\teRacks

      NAS (Network Attached Storage) category of servers is comprised of rackmount
      systems especially designed for data storage. The largest rackmount server,
      eRacks/NAS50, contains 50 hot-swappable hard drive bays. These systems are currently
      used by major radio stations and engineers for data retention, storing uncompressed
      media files, and backups.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tMax Haskvitz, general manager
      of eRacks, reacted with delight when asked about the upgraded eRacks/NAS50.
      &quot;We&#39;re especially excited to offer our customers the NAS50,&quot; he
      said. &quot;The ability to house 150TB in a single unit is extremely efficient
      for data warehouses and other storage-needy applications.&quot;</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tIn
      addition to 150TB of storage, the eRacks/NAS50 holds a maximum of two hexa-core
      Intel Xeon or two AMD Opteron CPUs for a total of 12 Intel cores or 24 AMD cores.
      Memory can be configured to a maximum of 128 GB, and multiple RAID arrays can
      be configured. eRacks also offers 4GbE and 10GbE network interfaces for the
      eRacks/NAS50 server. eRacks also allows an external SAS option to attach multiple
      NAS50 servers or other NAS units together to approach a petabyte-level storage.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tSwapping
      a smaller drive for a 3TB drive may require changes in the partition configuration.
      On-site technical experts at eRacks will pre-install RAID systems, partitions
      and operating systems, and upgrade or repair servers.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks

      also just 4U in height, yet with 88 drive bays, in either a SATAII or SAS JBOD
      setup, that can be configured in RAID formats as well. The DAS88 is also the
      largest single DAS unit on the market.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n
      \                   Both devices come with SAS expansion options, and feature
      a setup based around a double-sided approach \_to storage. This breakthrough
      was made possible by eRacks advanced cooling system and experience with network

      also tooled to be environmentally friendly as they utilize both the RoHS approved
      components and a power supply that is rated as 93 percent efficient compared
      to the industry standard of 75-80. The NAS72 system also has a smaller footprint,
      but still offers between 30-50% more drive bays then most current offerings

      uncompromising performance.\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tOrange, CA (PRWEB) June 1, 2009
      -- eRacks Open Source Systems is now offering a new powerful and energy-saving
      server, utilizing Intel&#39;s newest Xeon 5500 series microprocessor. The eRacks/NSERVE
      is unprecedented in its energy-efficiency. It is an ideal choice for use in
      biometrics, telemetry, video and audio encoding, virtualization, as part of
      a private cloud, or any high level computational application.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe
      new Xeon processor series, codenamed Nehalem, utilizes Intel&#39;s Turbo Boost
      technology to intelligently clock the cores up if needed and if the temperature
      allows. Energy use is scaled to the workload by enabling individual cores to
      reduce to near-zero power under lighter use. The eRacks/NSERVE has a comparably
      reduced server power consumption, and will also lower the cooling cost of the
      data center.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe eRacks/NSERVE rackmount server supports
      DDR3 memory up to 1333MHz, has three hot-swap SATA2 drives, and uses 4 middle
      fans for effective cooling. All eRacks systems are configured with the customer&#39;s
      choice of operating system, including a wide choice of Linux flavors, OpenBSD,
      and FreeBSD.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks has specialized in providing customized

      CA (PRWEB) April 7, 2009 -- eRacks Open Source Systems is now offering 2-terabyte
      drives in its NAS (Network Attached Storage) line of rackmount servers. The
      systems range from 8TB capacity in a 4-drive 1U-height rackmount chassis to
      the behemoth 50-drive 9U system with a capacity of 100TB. Data storage is a
      growing concern for data-heavy video and other media-based files. Cloud and
      other enterprise storage servers are the focus for these systems.\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks
      NAS systems incorporates Western Digital&#39;s new Caviar Green 2TB drive, which
      uses less power and is quieter than a typical hard drive. The large-capacity
      drives&#39; technology include system-induced vibration reduction, spin-speed
      fine-tuning, and calculations for optimally seeking speeds to lower power consumption,
      noise, and vibration. Data reliability is achieved through a choice of RAID
      configurations of 10, 5, 6, 1 or 0. RAID 6, striped disks with dual parity,
      makes it possible to recreate data even under a double disk failure.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe
      basic price of an eRacks server includes standard or customized file system
      partitioning and RAID configuration. An extensive list of operating systems
      are offered online. eRacks&#39; innovative NOSS (Network Operation System Server)
      technology allows easy configuration with a choice of back-end storage protocols
      automatically, including iSCSI &amp; NFS, AoE (ATA over Ethernet), Samba / CIFS,
      and Appletalk.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks can install OpenFiler, an open
      source alternative to the NetApp Filer, on request. OpenFiler supports RAID,
      Fiber Channel, full iSCSI (target and initiator), point-in-time snapshots, replication,
      and has a convenient Web-based GUI.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t&quot;We&#39;re
      pleased that eRacks is able to deliver dense rackmount storage in a green, energy-efficient
      platform,&quot; remarked Joseph Wolff, CEO.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks has
      specialized in providing customized open source rackmount and desktop servers
      since 1999. The company also offers dedicated hosting services and maintains
      a close partnership with The Libre Group, consultants with expertise in open

      2009<br />\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks Open Source Systems announces a new shallow-depth
      rackmount computer model, the eRacks/STUBBY, intended for broadcast and audio
      studios as well as other applications where rack shelves are limited in depth.
      This system is ideal for music, recording, and broadcast studios, business applications
      requiring in-office or tabletop-racks, kiosks, projection systems, and lectern
      or console installations.</p>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<a href=\"/products/shallow-depth\"><img

      /></a><br />\r\n\t\t\t<a href=\"/products/config?sku=STUBBY\">eRacks/STUBBY</a></div>\r\n\t\tThe
      eRacks/STUBBY computer measures 8.75 inches in depth, fits 19 inch standard-width
      rackmount shelves, and is 1U in height, or 1.75 inches. eRacks sells a selection
      of shallow-depth rackmount servers, including low-power and silent systems.
      All eRacks systems are configured with the customer&#39;s choice of operating
      system.\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe eRacks/STUBBY can be configured with a choice
      of Mini-ITX motherboards using either a 1.6GHz single or dual core Intel Atom
      processor. The system is relatively quiet, utilizing a 140 watt power supply
      and only one low-rotation-speed 40mm chassis fan. If the application requires
      system noise to be at a minimum, eRacks recommends replacement of the hard drive
      with a flash-based solid-state drive (SSD). This configuration makes an excellent
      Linux rackmount Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for a recording studio.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks
      has specialized in providing customized open source rackmount and desktop servers
      since 1999. Its line of customized quiet servers, especially designed for noise-sensitive
      environments, are popular with recording studios and radio stations.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks

      11, 2009</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe recent economic upheaval has raised the level of
      urgency and reframed the argument for open source software. Focus questions
      of IT have changed from the likes of &#39;Should we consider open source software?&#39;
      to &#39;When and how can we migrate our business applications to open source?&#39;
      Rapid development and advances in open source software, in combination with
      growing awareness of vendor lock-in with recurring license fees, have further
      contributed to open source adoption.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFaced with flat or cut
      budgets, CIOs, CTOs, and IT planners have been pushed out of their comfort zone.
      Many are developing strategies to use open source software, avoiding expensive
      operating costs. eRacks Open Source Systems reports orders for servers configured
      with Linux and *BSD have risen significantly the last few months.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut
      it&#39;s not just about operating costs. Open source software returns control
      to the user. It allows customization, avoids forced unneeded upgrades and recurring
      license fees. Support for open source software is both freely accessible and
      available for purchase. Red Hat, Sun Microsystems, EnterpriseDB, MySQL and others
      now have corporate support programs for open source software. Open source has
      long been prevalent in the web and back-end Internet services. Now it is in
      common use in databases, CMS (Content Management Systems), and other applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Having
      received multiple purchase orders just in the last few weeks from organizations
      like University of Southern California, Broadcom Corp., the US Army, the Dept
      of Energy, and NASA, we see that open source has truly hit the mainstream in
      the server market,&quot; comments Joseph Wolff, CEO of eRacks. One typical computer
      configuration requested at eRacks is an Intel&reg; Core i7 CPU rackmount server,
      installed with Ubuntu, Fedora, Centos, or Red Hat Linux. This high power system
      is often the first choice for a server dedicated to the analysis of large data
      sets.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks has specialized in providing customized open source
      rackmount and desktop servers since 1999. The company also maintains a close

      - eRacks announces its latest offering of both the 4 and the 8 CPU Westmere-EX
      processors in its NAS line of servers. Earlier this year, Intel released two
      new lines of Xeon processors, the E7-4800 series (for systems with up to four
      processors) and the E7-8800 series (for systems with up to 8 processors), both
      codenamed Westmere-EX. These CPUs sport a new socket (socket 1567), up to 10
      cores per processor (for a total of 20 threads of execution) and up to 30MB
      of cache.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The
      eRacks/NAS6X sports as many as 40 cores and 512GB of RAM, whereas the eRacks/NAS16X
      sports up to 80 cores and 1TB of RAM. Both systems are therefore ideal for any
      applications that require massive parallelism and large quantities of memory.
      And, with Intel claiming 40% greater performance as compared to the Xeon 7500
      series, the end user is assured more performance for less cost. Intel says that
      these processors \"support massively scalable deployments and mission-critical
      workloads.\"\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The
      new series are also more energy efficient than previous models, as various parts
      of the CPU can now be shut down when not in use. This saves the end user money,
      making the new Xeons a good investment.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n

      and preconfigured, rackmount server solutions are also available including NAS
      (Network Attached Storage) systems.\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tOrange,
      CA (PRWEB) April 29, 2011 -- April 29, 2011 eRacks today announces the availability
      of 10 gigabit ethernet (10GbE) across the board on its entire line of enterprise-grade
      servers, available in three flavors: CX4, RJ-45 (both copper) or SFP+ (fiber
      optic.)</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tPreviously, mainstream servers were limited
      to 1 gbps of bandwidth per network adapter, forcing systems administrators to
      resort to the cumbersome procedure of bonding NICs when more bandwidth was required.
      Now, eRacks offers 10x that performance, all through a single port.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\teRacks
      offers a host of choices when deciding on a 10GbE solution. Those who require
      only short range connections are free to choose from CX4 or the fiber optic
      interface SFP+, and will most likely want SFP+ when a low-power low-latency
      connection is desired. Conversely, those who require up to 100m of cabling will
      want to explore the RJ-45 option.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t10GbE is crucial
      for any system that needs to move large amounts of data back and forth across
      a network. 10GbE makes a great foundation for network attached storage, for
      example, and works exceptionally well with technologies such as iSCSI. 10GbE
      is also highly useful for the rendering of high definition audio and video across
      a network and can easily find a home in any studio.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tNow
      is an ideal time to invest in 10GbE, as costs are finally coming down and adoption
      is becoming much more common.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tAbout eRacks Open
      Source Systems:<br />\r\n\t\t\t\teRacks has been on the forefront of technology

      8, 2009</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks Open Source Systems is now offering Asus, MSI,
      and Acer Netbooks preinstalled with Ubuntu or Fedora Linux. eRacks&#39; netbooks
      use Intel&#39;s new Atom processor and are smaller, lighter, and more portable
      than laptops. Netbooks are also significantly less expensive but can easily
      handle the daily tasks like web-browsing, email, writing documents and spreadsheets.
      Other vendors sell netbooks with a simplified version of Linux, such as Linpus,
      but eRacks goes the extra step and configures the fully functional Linux operating
      system on its netbooks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLinux is especially suited for netbooks,
      whereas Microsoft Vista is considered to be too resource-intensive. The increasing
      popularity of netbooks could be a significant step in the acceptance of open
      source software in the mainstream. Google&#39;s Android, an open source mobile
      phone platform, has already been successfully ported to netbooks(1). Further
      advances could easily lead to netbooks being used a phone application development
      platform, as well as a PDA, e-book reader, and smartphone replacement. The latest
      trends of web-based applications and cloud computing also create a unique market
      niche for netbooks as portable thin clients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith 10 years of
      experience in building computers preinstalled with open source operating systems,
      eRacks is prepared to meet the demands of these trends. &quot;eRacks has a strong
      reputation in providing customized rackmount servers.&quot; remarked Joseph
      Wolff, CEO of eRacks, &quot;We welcome inquiries for production runs of specialized
      OSes including Google&#39;s Android, on any of our netbooks.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks
      netbooks come with Ubuntu or Fedora Linux preinstalled and include Open Office,
      an office suite of software, containing document, spreadsheet, and presentation
      software, compatible with both standard and Microsoft formats. Webcams and card
      readers are also standard on eRacks netbooks. eRacks netbooks start at $299.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout

      15, 2008</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks Open Source Systems announced a new desktop
      model that uses the recently-released, highly-acclaimed Intel Core i7 processor.
      The Core i7 CPU&#39;s architectural improvements include an integrated memory
      controller that doubles or even triples the peak memory bandwidth compared to
      other top of the line processors. To a user, this means increased multithreading
      performance, which is ideal for computationally-intensive applications including
      serious digital media creation, multi-application workloads, and heavy-duty
      gaming. Other Core i7 advances include a dynamic energy management, improving
      efficiency and energy utilization. While most desktops&#39; maximum memory is
      4-8 GB, the eRacks/i7DESK DDR3 system holds up to 24 GB. eRacks tailors the
      hardware configuration of each system to the user&#39;s specifications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEach
      eRacks computer also comes with a customizable set of open source software.
      Linux has long dominated the server market, and is now among the fastest growing
      operating systems in the desktop world. Improved security and performance, ease
      of installation of applications, and freedom from licensing restrictions are
      just a few of the advantages that Linux has over other more costly proprietary
      operating systems. The eRacks/i7DESK default configuration includes software
      such as Open Office, a suite of applications similar to Microsoft Office. Unlike
      MS Office, Open Office is compatible with many other office software formats,
      including older MS Office formats.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe eRacks/i7DESK is currently
      the only commercially available desktop computer configured with a wide choice
      of Linux flavors, including Ubuntu Linux. Extensive customization options include
      a choice of two i7-compatible motherboards, a &#39;quietization&#39; option,
      multiple graphics cards, and SSD drives. The price starts at $2095 and includes
      configuration. The eRacks/i7DESK is available online:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"/products/Desktops/config?sku=i7DESK\">/products/Desktops/config?sku=i7DESK</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout

      7, 2007</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks Open Source Systems, an industry leader among
      rackmount server providers since 1999, announces eRacks Hosting, a new division
      that will consolidate its dedicated hosting and colocation services. The eRacks
      Hosting facilities occupy racks in multiple Tier 1 datacenters in Silicon Valley,
      California, where the Internet backbone and peering are ranked among the top
      in the world.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks has previously offered hosting and colocation
      to a select group of customers. Demand for these services has risen sharply
      in recent years, as organizations have embraced the idea of outsourcing network
      operations due to concerns of security, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
      In response, eRacks has decided to extend and formalize its offerings, by creating
      eRacks Hosting, and launching an e-commerce website www.eRacksHosting.com.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks
      Hosting offers service in 3 levels: Standard, Professional and Enterprise, in
      addition to its customized packages. Base prices start at $129 monthly for a
      Core 2 Duo system (Standard plan). Dual-core (Professional plan) and quad-core
      systems (Enterprise plan) are also available. Service can be billed monthly,
      or yearly at a substantial discount. eRacks has long been an enthusiastic advocate
      of open source solutions, and offers systems configured with the clients&#39;
      choices of open source operating systems, including: Ubuntu Linux, OpenBSD,
      FreeBSD, NetBSD, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Red Hat Linux, SuSE Linux, and others.
      eRacks Hosting offers additional services, including installation and configuration
      of a set of virtualized servers on the client&#39;s dedicated server, as well
      as software development services. In addition, CPUs, hard drives and memory
      can be upgraded from the base configuration, and other customization is available.
      Further details can be found at www.eRacksHosting.com, where customers can explore
      their options and order directly online.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We have been
      offering customized hosting and colocation services for several years, and we
      are pleased to formally offer these services under the eRacks Hosting name.
      This will position us to continue expanding in this space without sacrificing
      the personalized support our customers expect.&quot; says Joseph Wolff, CEO
      and Founder of eRacks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks Hosting technical staff has extensive
      experience with both customization and virtualization. A recent project with
      Libre Hosting involved the development of a web-based virtualization infrastructure
      based on the Open Source Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM), which is built into the
      Linux kernel. Joseph Wolff adds, &quot;We think that our customers will be delighted
      by how easy and economical it is to set themselves up with one of our complete
      hosting plans through eRacksHosting.com. And as always, the eRacks personalized
      service and support is still there for those who require additional consulting
      or customization.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout eRacks: eRacks Open Source Systems

      19, 2007</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThanks to Canonical&#39;s System Builder Program, pre-installed
      Ubuntu Linux PCs are available throughout the world and not just from Dell.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEveryone
      in the Linux desktop world knows that Dell now offers Ubuntu Linux 7.04 on some
      of its laptops and desktops. Some also know that Dell will soon be offering
      the latest Ubuntu, 7.10, on its systems. Dell, however, is far from the only
      PC builder that offers Ubuntu to its customers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn March, London-based
      Canonical, Ubuntu&#39;s commercial sponsor, started its Partner Program to drive
      awareness and adoption of business-ready, open-source server platforms and desktop
      solutions. Canonical offers five partner tracks. One of them, the System Builder
      Program, is for dedicated OEMs, white-box builders and system integrators that
      want to pre-load their computers--desktops, laptops or servers--with Ubuntu.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaria
      Bonnefon, Canonical&#39;s OEM program manager, explained, &quot;We are mainly
      looking into replacing FreeDOS with a full operating system [that] is stable,
      reliable, secure and virtually virus-free. There are no licensing fees, and
      no additional charges for security or maintenance updates. All these elements
      mixed together make it so that Ubuntu becomes an ideal solution to serve a demand
      on desktops, laptops, servers and in even mobile devices. It fills a need for
      companies who wish to commercialize a complete solution in their PCs without
      having to make a substantial investment.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith this program,
      &quot;Canonical has established direct presence in focus countries including
      Brazil, Russia, India, China and Taiwan. This allows us to do proper follow-through
      in the channel, with timely support on-site. It also accelerates our response
      time to our partners, utilizing a local infrastructure and communicating in
      the local language. It gives us the possibility [of being] close to the partner
      to really plan and advance hand in hand.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo it is that
      you can get pre-installed Ubuntu with Canonical support from companies like
      Excimer and NT Computers in Russia, Navigator in the Ukraine, Inspur in China,
      and PC House in Sri Lanka.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCanonical also has Ubuntu system
      builders in English-speaking countries. These include EfficientPC in the United
      Kingdom and eRacks Open Source Systems and System76 in the United States. Canonical
      CEO Mark Shuttleworth said other companies that are not official Canonical partners
      also sell Ubuntu-powered systems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCanonical offers its partners
      several services, which include:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Configuration
      support for system builders with the option to make additional revenue by reselling
      Canonical support;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Specialized training for technical
      and sales teams;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Pre-sales support;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Hardware
      certification with access to Ubuntu logo use and promotion on Canonical&#39;s
      Web site;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Strong support in the education sector, with
      a specific operating system adapted to that market--Edubuntu;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Operating
      support for Classmate PC, a project currently being developed jointly with Intel;
      and<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Customization assistance to completely personalize
      a solution with applications, logos and sound support, as done for the Ubuntu
      Mobile core on the Mobile Internet Device.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We are delighted
      to see a number of top local OEMs adhering to the program on a global basis,&quot;
      Bonnefon said. &quot;We are very satisfied with the progress made thus far,
      and believe there is still a long way to go.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn particular,
      Bonnefon noted, &quot;The number of first-time computer users within emerging
      markets is huge and acceptance of an operating system that is different more
      viable. Also, these are users that would be more sensitive to pricing.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLooking
      ahead, &quot;We believe that we are only at the beginning of an inevitable turn
      in the way people perceive a Linux OS,&quot; she said. And, as for the business
      side of delivering Ubuntu-powered desktops and laptops, &quot;We will continue
      to listen closely to the channel, conceive and adapt services per demand, and
      develop solutions that best fit the needs of our partners,&quot; Bonnefon concluded.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&mdash;Steven

      at near-native speeds. The pre-installed software enables one system to do the
      work of several independent appliance servers simultaneously. Virtualization
      is a compelling solution for those requiring to maintain multiple environments,
      plan server consolidation, or create a testing sandbox environment for new applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks
      Open Source Systems provides servers that are preinstalled with the virtualization
      software as well as customers&#39; choices of virtual appliances. eRacks is
      known for offering the widest choice of Open Source operating systems and applications
      pre-installed with their rackmount servers. The eRacks / SUITE model can be
      configured with open-source VMWare or Linux-native KVM (Kernel-based Virtual
      Machine) virtualization software as well as a large number of possible virtual
      operating systems and applications, including web, DNS, email, proxy and other
      infrastructure services. eRacks&#39; technical team works individually with
      each customer to arrive at the best configuration to meet the given requirements.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCombined
      with the latest processors, virtualization is poised to revolutionize network
      infrastructure design. Instead of isolating applications in under-utilized individual
      machines, several virtual appliances can exist in encapsulated images within
      one physical system. This partitioned server is more cost-efficient and easier
      to manage than separate machines. Since each virtual environment is hardware
      independent, and its image (operating system, application, data and state) all
      reside within a single file, backups are simple, and running on a different
      hardware platform is not a problem. Hardware virtualization allows each virtual
      machine to run directly with the compatible processor(s), avoiding the performance
      penalties of simulators.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith the host running Linux, it is
      possible to run multiple virtual environments each running different operating
      systems, including legacy Windows versions. Running a less stable operating
      system on a virtual machine instead of a physical one, actually increases its
      availability since restarts are simple and fast. Isolating unstable and easily-compromised
      software in virtual environments provides increased security and fast recovery,
      as well. Virtualization can also solve many disaster recovery issues, especially
      when downtime cost is compared.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause the eRacks / SUITE server
      arrives with the software already installed and tested, the system avoids any
      hardware incompatibilities and is optimized and qualified for hardware virtualization.
      Customized configurations comprise a large part of eRacks&#39; sales and many
      systems are completed on a quote basis. eRacks also offers network design assistance
      as well as consulting, available through their business alliances.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout

      CA, USA<br />\r\n\tFebruary 27, 2007</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks offers a new donation
      pathway to The OpenBSD Project.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe increasing popularity of
      open source software is changing how businesses interact. A growing number of
      businesses depend on open source software projects as part of their infrastructure
      or their product and services. It makes sense that such corporations find a
      way to empower those projects. eRacks Open Source Systems is doing exactly that.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOpen
      Source software projects are typically funded solely by donations from grateful
      users. Since eRacks incorporates open source software in nearly all of its computers,
      it makes sense for the company to construct a new avenue for donations. eRacks&#39;
      customers are now easily able to make a donation toward the OpenBSD Project
      along with the purchase of an eRacks rackmount server, with the simple click
      of a dropdown choice.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks specializes in open source installations
      and has shipped configured OpenBSD systems since 1999, to a loyal and growing
      customer base. Because the software is open source, a user has full control
      of his application, and is not subject to license fees, renewals, and restrictions.
      Moreover, customization is possible without needing to purchase rights to the
      code.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOpenBSD is a Unix-like operating system, well-known for
      both its high security and reliability. It has been particularly successful
      at avoiding default security holes, and has an exceptionally rigorous auditing
      process. OpenBSD is freely redistributable under the open source BSD license.
      Typical applications that are best suited to run on OpenBSD are those that require
      strong security such as bastion hosts, intrusion detection, perimeter firewalls,
      bandwidth managers, mail filter gateways, VPN (Virtual Private Network), DMZ
      (DeMilitarized Zone), NAT (Network Address Translation), and DNS (Domain Name
      Server) servers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe OpenBSD project also authors OpenSSH, which
      is crucial to management of large data centers. OpenSSH is a free implementation
      of the IETF-standardized SSH connectivity protocol connectivity toolset that
      allow functions like file transfers and remote login. This is an essential improvement
      over the older tools such as telnet, rlogin, and ftp, where the user&#39;s password
      is transmitted unencrypted. OpenSSH&#39;s encryption routines eliminate password
      snooping, eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. OpenSSH is
      the most widely used implementation of the SSH protocol, and is included in
      products from IBM, Apple, HP, Sun, and Cisco.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe OpenBSD project
      and OpenSSH are both coordinated in Canada by Theo de Raadt, while the development
      team is globally distributed. Because OpenBSD is officially based in Canada
      and avoids restrictive U.S. cryptography export laws, the developers have been
      able to embed cryptographic components in numerous places within the operating
      system, increasing its security. The OpenBSD Project is funded solely by donations
      and sales of its CDs and Tshirts. &quot;The OpenBSD project is impressed by
      the novel approach eRacks has taken, which allows their customers to easily
      contribute towards the open source software which will operate on their servers.
      eRacks&#39; customers should take careful note of how this enlightened approach
      attempts to make sure that the OpenBSD and OpenSSH projects are better funded,
      and thus able to continue innovating these free products which much of the industry
      so heavily depends on.&quot; notes Theo De Raadt, coordinator of the OpenBSD
      and OpenSSH Projects.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;eRacks is proud to provide a route
      for donations to the OpenBSD Project. Rock-solid security is a top priority
      for most of our customers; OpenBSD provides this.&quot; comments Joseph Wolff,
      CEO of eRacks Open Source Systems. &quot;Our corporate customers have already
      realized the advantages of utilizing reliable and secure open source software
      in their critical business processes.&quot; eRacks&#39; future plans include
      expanding its donation program to other segments of the open source community.
      It is in the best interest of a corporation to contribute back to the community
      on which it depends, insist eRacks&#39; managers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout eRacks:<br

      hum of a server is a sign of two things: that there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount
      of power inside the enclosure, and that the fans are working overtime to make
      sure there are no excessive heat problems, which can cause crashes&mdash;or
      worse. Yet for anyone who works in a smaller data center or even keeps a row
      of servers close at hand in an office cubicle, server hum can be distracting
      and make it hard to hear when talking on the phone, for instance. Not every
      data center is situated in a server room where you can occasionally check on
      system status and run admin utilities. Instead, you might have a server right
      under your desk.</p>\r\n<h5>\r\n\tQuiet Down!</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\tServer quietization
      is one of the key issues for small to midsized enterprises, a problem that a
      larger enterprise rarely needs to address. For the most part, the issue has
      become more noticeable as power output has increased and data centers rely on
      more and more servers to run the business. Server manufacturers use several
      methods to make servers operate as quietly as possible.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFan
      placement, low-decibel fans, heatpipes, watercooling, and optimized airflow
      inside the chassis can all help reduce noise. Fanless systems, which are much
      more expensive and use an array of heatsinks, heatpipes, and other cooling methods,
      also provide an innovative approach.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;Small to medium-sized
      companies tend to utilize tower-based platforms that are often colocated with
      employees, so noise levels can greatly affect productivity in these environments,&rdquo;
      says Christina Tiner, group manager of Industry Standard Server product marketing
      at HP (www.hp.com). &ldquo;Mechanical designs of the servers greatly impact
      acoustics. Fan location and airflow patterns determine the amount of air required
      to cool the system.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;The latest trend is to make
      sure that the air path from the front of the system to the processor is as clear
      as possible,&rdquo; adds Ken Haugen, the director of server engineering at Gateway
      Computers (www.gateway.com). &ldquo;Any active component other than a fan in
      that air path will preheat or slow down the air path, forcing the fan to run
      faster to keep the processor cool and make more noise. Other trends in keeping
      servers quiet include counter-rotating fans, thicker and slower fans, and larger
      processor heatsinks. Finally, the latest-generation processors use much less
      power than previous generations, which decreases the thermal load and allows
      the system to run quieter. Some manufacturers also use liquid cooling, but this
      adds too much cost for most applications and is less reliable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaugen
      notes that companies that situate servers near employees should look for server
      manufacturers that design quiet servers, relying on low-decibel fans and highly
      optimized CPUs that are designed for whisper-quiet operation. He notes that
      some server rack manufacturers have designed cabinets that use sound-dampening
      techniques, but the heat output and power drain for these cabinets sometimes
      negates their value.</p>\r\n<h5>\r\n\tThe Marketplace For Quiet Servers</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne
      company that specializes in quiet servers is eRacks Open Source Systems (eracks.com),
      which offers products designed for smaller companies that may not have a server
      room. There are two main product offerings for low-decibel servers: those with
      a fanless design that are fully silent and those that are quietized with optimally
      placed, low-noise fans.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;Placement and location of internal
      fans is key, and we select and specify only certain chassis designs which meet
      our criteria for fan placement and location to avoid or minimize auditory noise
      leakage from the chassis,&rdquo; says Joseph J. Wolff, eRacks&rsquo; CTO and
      founder. &ldquo;We also use only the best available noncontact fan technology,
      and at the lowest fan RPMs possible, to drastically reduce the noise produced
      by each individual fan, usually to about 1/10 of the original decibel level
      output.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNixsys (www.nixsys.com) is another company that
      has received customer requests for fanless and low-noise servers. Nicolas Szczedrin,
      a Nixsys spokesperson, says the requests sometimes come from small multimedia
      companies and recording studios that require servers with high processing power,
      yet the companies don&rsquo;t want to disrupt any of their daily activities.
      He says one partial solution is to use a chassis for a server that can automatically
      regulate fans for low-decibel operation, but he says the trade-off is in the
      extra heat buildup.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;We have had more acceptance with
      quiet fans because they are very quiet, and if they are well-designed and tested
      properly, you can use a very large range of processors and components, making
      the systems more powerful, easy to upgrade, and lower cost,&rdquo; Szczedrin
      says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShuttle (www.shuttle.com) also makes systems that operate
      at low decibels and can be used as servers. Its XPC-SB83G2B system uses a silent
      power supply, an &ldquo;integrated cooling engine&rdquo; to manage airflow,
      and fans that change their speed depending on the processor requirements. Shuttle
      systems have the added advantage for smaller companies in that the chassis is
      remarkably small.</p>\r\n<h5>\r\n\tServer Or Rack Issue?</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost
      server manufacturers agree that quietization is mostly a server issue, not a
      rack issue. If the server itself is noisy, sound-dampening racks typically just
      obstruct airflow. Some companies, such as NEC (www.nec.com) and eRacks, do have
      rackmountable servers that use liquid cooling, so they operate in near silence.
      These liquid-cooled, rackmount servers are typically more expensive but operate
      at the lowest decibels possible.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to eRacks&rsquo;
      Wolff, &ldquo;We can centralize the pump, tank, and cooling infrastructure for
      a rack of multiple servers using manifold technology.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn
      the end, running a quiet server has many benefits for smaller companies. It
      means a server room is less of a requirement down the road, and admins can keep
      systems in the same office and have easy access to server utilities and monitoring
      software.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tby John Brandon</p>\r\n", created: ! '2006-12-08 00:00:00',

      world of open-source software offers reduced pricing and more relaxed licensing
      agreements, both good for smaller businesses as well as large enterprise-level
      operations. As Unix gains in popularity and requires some technical acumen,
      companies selling turnkey Unix workstations and server systems are fulfilling
      a very real need.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks Open Source Systems is offering ready-to-run
      desktop and server systems loaded with various versions of the open source,
      Linux-based Ubuntu operating system. This Linux distribution is derived from
      Debian Linux.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong its various offerings, the company has recently
      finished testing a new model: eRacks/FOCUS, a truly noiseless high-power AMD64
      workstation. Another new product offering from the company is the eRacks/LITE
      system, a shallow-depth (13-inch) 1U rackmount system. The system has been optimized
      for low noise output. The LITE system has been engineered for environments where
      space is at a premium, as well as shops where noise must be kept to a minimum
      such as for audio-/video-editing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor many work settings, sound
      generation from the machine can be a major issue. According to Britta Serog
      with eRacks Open Source Systems marketing, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve developed many
      different &lsquo;quietized&rsquo; systems on customers&rsquo; requests. Machine
      noise is a bigger problem than the big computer manufacturers realize. Not everyone
      can put their rackmount systems into a soundproof server room; many systems
      are used for audio applications, such as video-editing, radio broadcast, hospital
      data management, etc.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe competition for eRacks comes
      from some of the major computer manufacturers, as well as various Unix providers.
      Serog says, &ldquo;These include the big players, namely Dell, HP, etc. But
      these companies generally don&rsquo;t offer the degree of customization that
      eRacks does, especially in terms of operating system choice, as well as system
      quietization. Smaller players that compete concentrating on open-source operating
      systems include Pogo Linux [www.pogolinux.com] and Penguin Computing [www.penguincomputing.com],
      but these companies typically offer only varieties of Red Hat and SuSE Linux
      and tend to ignore OpenBSD and other open-source operating systems.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks
      is currently offering the following Ubuntu distributions: Ubuntu Server; Edubuntu
      for educational uses; Kubuntu, which is based on KDE environment; and Xubuntu
      for low-end systems and thin clients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to providing
      custom turnkey hardware platforms, eRacks will install drivers and various software
      on request and provides consulting, network configuration, and open-source enterprise
      migration planning.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tby Joe Lazzaro</p>\r\n", created: ! '2006-09-29

      Linux</a> is growing rapidly in popularity, reports eRacks Open Source Systems,
      where Ubuntu and other OSes are configured-to-order on computer servers and
      workstations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLinux is an open source, freely-licensed, collaboratively-developed
      operating system, offering perpetual upgrades and world-wide support. These
      ideals dovetail with eRacks&#39; mission of enabling their customers to maintain
      complete control of their own business infrastructure and not be governed by
      licensing restrictions and third-party proprietary lock-in. Ubuntu and other
      varieties of Linux come with a suite of free (libre) open source software including
      email, office and even graphics applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUbuntu, whose
      tagline is &#39;Linux for Human Beings&#39;, strongly focuses on usability.
      It is derived from Debian Linux, inheriting its convenient update methods of
      synaptic and apt-get. Other Ubuntu distributions include Edubuntu aimed at school
      use, Kubuntu based on KDE (K Desktop Environment), and Xubuntu using Xfce Desktop
      for low-end systems and thin-clients. The Ubuntu Server is secure by default,
      has no open ports after installation, and contains only essential server software.
      eRacks offers customization in software installations, and can install the Server
      Edition, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, and Xubuntu, as well as bleeding-edge or legacy
      versions. eRacks also takes advantage of Ubuntu&#39;s multiverse repository
      to install hardware drivers and software such as Java, Flash, and Real Audio
      on request.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA new version of Ubuntu is released every six months,
      and has security update support for minimally 18 months, to 5 years for some
      versions such as Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Server (long term support). Because of its
      rapidly growing popularity, the Ubuntu community is strong, and resources can
      be easily found. Canonical Ltd, the lead sponsors of Ubuntu, offers commercial
      enterprise-class support. Ubuntu web forums and IRC channels exist in many countries,
      and a searchable wiki dedicated to Ubuntu is found at wiki.ubuntu.com. Along
      with the computer hardware, eRacks Open Source Systems also offers software
      consulting, network configuration, as well as open source enterprise migration
      planning.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCustomized installations and build-to-order are eRacks&#39;
      specialty. eRacks is well-known for <a href=\"http://eracks.com/quiet\">&quot;quietized&quot;</a>

      25, 2005</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLaguna Beach, CA -</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of the most
      vulnerable points of a corporate network is its firewall, yet many large businesses
      are ill-equipped to ensure seamless, uninterrupted operation in the event of
      its failure. A typical corporate network&#39;s firewall system can be a single
      point of failure. If down, users on both sides of the firewall, inside and out,
      would be unable to access email or Internet until the firewall system has been
      repaired. In many corporate environments, this would likely be at great expense
      and frustration. System administrators and computer users: take heart. There
      is a better way to do firewalls, as eRacks Open Source Systems has announced
      their low-cost solution to this risk: the eRacks/TWINGUARD.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe
      eRacks/TWINGUARD is a redundant, dual-firewall system enclosed in a single,
      compact 1.75 inch shallow-depth rackmount chassis. It comes preconfigured with
      a tried and true combination of secure open-source software to achieve redundancy,
      including OpenBSD and CARP. Two completely independent systems reside in one
      chassis: two power supplies, two hard drives and two motherboards - all of which
      are industry-standard components. Now, with the eRacks/TWINGUARD, in the event
      of a firewall failure, the secondary firewall automatically assumes the role
      of the primary and all network traffic flows uninterrupted. All of this would
      happen in the blink of an eye, and users would not even know that their day
      was saved by the eRacks/TWINGUARD.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen high availability and
      fault-tolerant hardware is a requirement, the eRacks/TWINGUARD is an extremely
      effective and scalable solution. System administrators have complete control
      over the configuration and can obtain updates without any licensing fees because
      the firewall system is solely based on open source software. Technical support
      is freely available in online open source user communities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor
      a detailed description of the eRacks/TWINGUARD, please visit: <a href=\"http://eracks.com/products/Firewall%20Servers/config?sku=TWINGUARD\">http://eracks.com/products/Firewall%20Servers/config?sku=TWINGUARD</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn
      a nutshell, the eRacks/TWINGUARD is the ultimate in firewalls. Not only is it
      a space-saving, fail-safe system, but it is also built with non-proprietary
      components, equipped with robust, proven open-source software, and founded on
      the rock-solid security of OpenBSD. Most importantly, it is crafted by a system
      integrator well-versed in open-source solutions: eRacks Open Source Systems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout

      Foundation is the first organization to be associated with eRacks&#39; new program.
      The EFF&#39;s mission is to protect &amp; ensure individiuals&#39; digital rights.
      Current EFF projects include activities to support consumer fair use, digital
      privacy, online freedom of speech, appropriate use of digital rights management
      (DRM), shrinkwrap / clickwrap license issues, the first sale doctrine, censorship,
      peer-to-peer systems &amp; substantial noninfringing uses, the appropriate use
      of copyright &amp; patent law, and appropriate legal treatment of reverse engineering
      rights.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMore information about the EFF can be found on the EFF
      website, http://www.eff.org. The continuing development of open source software
      depends on the free exchange of information.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks&#39; mission
      is to enable its customers with control over their own technology, by providing
      rackmount computer servers already configured with open source software. The
      less an organization depends on third-party proprietary software within its
      infrastructure, the more it is free to plan and upgrade on its own schedule,
      rather than on the whims of often disinterested software providers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks&#39;
      donation program is developed at the response of customer requests. The choice
      of the donation recipient and amount is offered in eRacks&#39; checkout forms.
      Now, those who include a donation to an open source or digital rights organization
      as part of their hardware budget, will be able to accomplish both goals in one

      leasing arrangements, increasing the accessibility of open source solutions
      to the SMB market (small and midrange businesses). Leasing a suite of rackmount
      servers is now possible for as little as $68 a month, with rates dependent on
      quantity and type of systems leased, length of lease, and credit approval. A
      lease assumes and manages the risk of equipment ownership. Leasing allows businesses
      to meet their technology needs quickly without an up-front investment and also
      offers significant tax advantages.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEnabling the enterprise by
      bringing control back to businesses is eRacks&#39; mission. eRacks&#39; systems
      are built with high-quality non-proprietary industry-standard hardware components,
      so that their computers are easily upgradable. By offering open source operating
      systems and applications already configured, eRacks encourages businesses to
      limit their reliance on third-party closed-source software vendors for key applications,
      avoiding vendor lock-in. Increased security and reliability are also two important
      reasons why many major institutions choose to run their network infrastructure
      using open source software.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<i>It&#39;s all about control.</i><br
      />\r\n\tProprietary software often forces users&#39; business decisions by limiting
      interoperability with outside products, and requiring upgrade schedules. Infrastructure
      expansion and scalability may also be threatened, remaining dependent on proprietary
      software licenses. Using open source software, the business owner maintains
      control of the development of key business operations and is not dependent on
      an outside software vendor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks&#39; winning combination
      of leasing arrangements, open source software, and easily-upgradable hardware,
      offers unbeatable value to both the SMB market and the enterprise alike.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout

      Systems today announces the availability of a quad-CPU 64-bit computing powerhouse,
      the eRacks/QUADOPT. Memory and data-intensive applications such as CAD, animation/rendering,
      financial and scientific modeling all benefit from 64-bit computing because
      the AMD OpteronTM processor has 1 terabyte of addressable memory compared to
      only 4 gigabytes by 32-bit processors. The Opteron architecture also provides
      a seamless migration path to 64-bit computing, enabling users to run existing
      32-bit code.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks fuels the trend to 64-bit computing in the
      open source arena, by providing the hardware already configured and tested with
      the customer&#39;s choice of 64-bit operating systems. Already proven to run
      even legacy 32-bit applications faster than 32-bit CPUs, the move to 64-bits
      is now more compelling than ever.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe eRacks/QUADOPT is housed
      in a 4U chassis, and comes complete with four 800-series Opteron CPUs, dual
      Gigabit Ethernet, single 10/100 LAN, U320 SCSI, and redundant 500W power supplies.
      The eRacks/QUADOPT is priced competitively beginning at $9995. For more information,

      Systems recently revealed a pioneering extension to its online computer system
      configurator. Customers are now able to select from a live list of software
      packages to be installed on their server at the time they place their order.
      eRacks offers a finely-tuned Zope web application server customized with selected
      Zope packages. These packages are chosen from an up-to-date set of components
      available on zope.org, the official website for the Zope community.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks
      management has indicated that this new level of customization is the beginning
      of an exciting, new trend that enables customers to completely customize their
      hardware and software preferences. Joseph Wolff, founder of eRacks explains,
      &quot;Our goal at eRacks is to return control of technology to the enterprise,
      freeing our customers from critical dependence on third-party software vendors,
      and lowering both their cost and risk. This is why we promote open source software
      and customize our servers to such a fine degree. We want to provide that head-start
      advantage to our customers.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn keeping with eRacks&#39;
      philosophy, the eRacks/ZOPE application server is designed for high-performance
      and reliability. The server is customized to include any set of Zope packages,
      as well as other configurable components. The company&#39;s experience with
      Zope extends from its own web server to numerous enterprise-level implementations.
      Zope is a Python-based web application server. It features a transactional object
      database, stores both content and code, and enables fully dynamic web pages.
      Its tight security capabilities enable granular permission control as well as
      web-based authoring. Numerous Zope components vastly extend the basic set of
      site building tools. These include connectors to relational databases and other
      external data sources, issue tracking, and e-commerce among others.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe
      eRacks/ZOPE server is competitively priced and is available at www.eRacks.com.

      rackmount server line, eRacks Open Source Systems this week unveiled the high-performance
      SILENCE tower and Quiet GBOX, a modified version of the hot-selling cube desktop
      GBOX.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEspecially designed for noise-sensitive business environments,
      the original QUIET rackmount server has made its way into recording studios,
      corporate boardrooms, and home entertainment theaters across the country. With
      the arrival of the SILENCE and the compact Quiet GBOX, eRacks extends its reach
      beyond the boardroom and home entertainment theaters and into virtually all
      work environments that desire or require low noise computing. Universities,
      public libraries, government offices, graphic designers, lawyers, architects,
      engineers, and even students can now benefit from eRacks&#39; Quiet Technology.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe
      eRacks/QUIET, SILENCE, and Quiet GBOX are all measured to run within 5 decibels
      above the baseline quiet room measurement of 28-30dB. The SILENCE is 2 dB above
      baseline, the Quiet GBOX cube comes in at 3dB above baseline, and the 1U-height
      rackmount QUIET is just 4-5 dB above baseline.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe eRacks/SILENCE
      tower server employs a rubber gasket around its front door and sound-deadening
      foam inside the top and sides. The sleek Pentium4 aluminum system is customizable
      both in choice of hardware as well as operating system. Test measurements, pictures,

      specializing in open source technologies, announced the release of eRacks/OpenMirror,
      a turnkey solution ideal for small and mid-size businesses needing realtime
      data mirroring between remote sites.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe eRacks/OpenMirror solution
      was recently installed at a Fortune 50 telecommunications corporation for two
      of its remote offices, located over 500 miles apart. Each office now seamlessly
      reads and writes data to the local storage server, which is instantaneously
      and bidirectionally replicated to the server at the other site.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe
      eRacks/OpenMirror is designed for data redundancy, fault tolerance, low latency,
      fast data access, and other high-availability network application needs. The
      system utilizes solely open source software including LinuxTM, DRBD1(distributed
      remote block device) data mirroring, OpenAFS2 architecture, and client-server
      authentication3 technologies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCompanies of all sizes that require
      remote office data access and manageability stand to benefit from this and similar
      eRacks open source implementations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor more information, please

      href=\"/press\">Press Release</a></p>\r\n<h5>\r\n\teRacks Preconfigured Rackmount
      Systems Focus on Open Source Software.</h5>\r\n<h5>\r\n\t<em>Laguna Beach, CA
      (April 20, 2001) --</em></h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs many administrators know, setting
      up a network can be an overwhelming task. Designing the layout, purchasing the
      hardware and software, and configuring everything must take into account the
      latest in security technology.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks offers custom-tailored
      rackmount servers to network designers and provides them with a some helpful
      advice as to what would best suit their needs. For instance, eRacks experts,
      may advise a network designer to use the OpenBSD operating system in his or
      her firewall machines because of its superior reliabilty and well-tested security.
      And since eRacks servers arrive preconfigured, software configuration is kept
      to a minimum.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe use of open source software is certainly not
      new to the Internet. According to Opensource.Org, &quot;Apache runs over 50%
      of the world&#39;s web servers&quot; currently, and that sendmail is &quot;the
      most important and widely used email transport software on the Internet.&quot;
      The OpenBSD operating system is designed with security as a priority, and the
      website proclaims that its operating system has enjoyed &quot;three years without
      a remote hole in the default install.&quot; An open source code policy permits
      very fast bug fixes, while proprietary source code updates usually have a much
      higher turn-around time. Free distribution ensures the high quality of the software;
      there is no temptation for a vendor to release an early buggy release in order
      to achieve a few short-term sales</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy primarily using open source
      software in its systems, eRacks is able to offer custom-built ready-to-run systems
      at both low prices as well as high levels of reliability and security.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd
      unlike most competitiors, eRacks&#39; rackmount system prices are very competitive.
      The company builds servers designed using industry-standard components, unlike
      many big-name servers, which contain proprietary components that are only upgradable
      at high costs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks.com offers prospective customers easy
      navigation to the system category of their choise. Visitors can even configure
      and order the systems right off the Web site.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor more information
      visit eRacks.com.</p>\r\n<h6>\r\n\tAbout the company</h6>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks
      is managed by a small group of experienced network designers and system architects.
      The company was officially founded in the 3rd quarter of 2000, and has close
      ties with a team of security consultants, SecurityArchitects. Bringing over
      20 years of software and system design experience to the company, Joseph Wolff
      is the Chief Technologist and founder of eRacks. Joe remarks, &quot;Our goal
      at eRacks is to provide a needed service to system administrators and network
      designers, as well as to promote high-quality open source software.&quot;</p>\r\n<h6>\r\n\tContact

      immediately, it combines a rack usage of only 4U with a density of 36 drives
      (24 front and 12 rear), which, when combined with the current technology of
      widely available 4TB drives, yields a total storage of 144TB.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith
      the forthcoming 6TB drives from WD HGST, this will increase to 216 Terabytes*,
      giving a truly petascale solution in only 4U of rackspace.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis
      rounds out eRacks&#39; line of rackmount multi-drive storage servers and NAS
      solutions, nicely filling the gap between the 24-drive eRacks/NAS24 and the

      in only 4U, this represent a density / price breakthrough - using the best value
      (lowest price/TB) 3TB drives, this enables 108TB of raw storage in only 4U,
      and for less than $20,000, as configured on the eRacks website.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a

      populated, at a reduced price, to make it accessible at a lower initial price,
      and the storage can be increased later by filling the empty drive trays.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&#39;s
      signature service, eRacks will be happy to install any of the popular Linux
      distributions on request - Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, Centos, Fedora, even the
      Arch Linux distro, which is growing fast in popularity, as well as FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD, or other Open Source OSes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks will also pre-install
      any open source NAS software, such as FreeNAS, OpenFIler, NAS4Free and OpenMediaVault,
      among others - and administrative dashboards and web GUIs are offered on most
      of these software choices.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlso available is best-of-breed Open
      Source software for BigData / Cloud storage, NAS, and networking - including
      Hadoop, MooseFS, CIFS, GlusterFS, etc - and eRacks is a partner with MooseFS.org.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn

      release, the term &quot;Terabyte&quot; is used to mean one trillion bytes -
      eRacks understands the issues about this, we are using the term as the disk

      the nation&rsquo;s leading solution provider dedicated to Open Source, announced
      today that they have released a new line of Petabyte-class servers, the NAS72.
      The NAS72 comes complete with 4U of Rackspace, and is equipped with advanced
      green drives that consume 23% less power than traditional drives.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks&rsquo;
      new <a class=\"trackingLink\" href=\"http://eracks.com/NAS72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NAS72</a>
      storage server solution features unparalleled economy of space, with 72 drive
      bays that can be configured to many different custom setups housed in a special
      chassis that takes up just 4U of Rackspace. Each of the bays in the NAS 72 is
      equipped with specially designed &ldquo;green&rdquo; drives noted for their
      energy efficiency. Each 6TB HGTS helium filled drive consumes 23% less power
      than traditional 4TB drives. This amounts to roughly half the energy usage per
      terabyte, making the massive storage capacity of 432TB both practical and affordable
      for nearly any server setup.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks is renowned in the industry
      for their dedication to and expertise with the Open Source movement, with many
      of their products coming pre-installed and pre-configured with open source software
      like OpenStack, CloudStack and Eucalyptus, among others. The new <a class=\"trackingLink\"
      href=\"http://eracks.com/NAS72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NAS72 cloud storage server</a>
      solution is no different, and can be pre-configured with OpenStack for truly
      superior results.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;With the confluence of the highest storage
      density available, &#39;Green&#39; miserly power usage, and sheer storage size,
      the eRacks/NAS72 brings an unprecedented level of utility to the cloud marketplace,&rdquo;
      said Joe Wolff, CTO and Founder of eRacks. &ldquo;When combined with our available
      OpenStack pre-installation/pre-configuration services, it&#39;s a truly unbeatable
