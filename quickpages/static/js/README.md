Django-QuickPages no longer uwes TinyMCE by d4efault.

It now uses django-wysiwyg, which is sert up to use CKEditor (v4.x as of this writing) by default,
but can still be configured for TinyMCE if desired.

This mce-setup file is left here as an example for those who may wish to use it.
Also, it serves as an example if you want to add a CKEditor config file here.
